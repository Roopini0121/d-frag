##Machine learning for sperm collection

###prologue

~ 50 million couples experience fertility related issues
- >2.5 million cycles performed annually
- success rate of ART has remained ~ 33.3


quality of oocytes is crucial for success of ART cycle. Majority of oocytes are selected either for use in the current ART cycle or frozen for the next cycle. But only around 25k to 150k sperms are selected for IVF. for ICSI a single selected sperm is manipulated and directly injected into the egg. 
clinical procedures for selection of sperms involves density centrifugation - the contents are put in a density medium and this will separate spermatozoa with good morphology at the bottom. 
swim up assay - to test the motility of the sperms within the fluid. The semen is placed in test tube and medium is placed on top of this. after a while the test tube is placed vertical. The sperms are taken from the upper meniscus downwords
even after these we are left with ~1% of the original sperm count out of which we need to narrow it down to 100 - 1000. After this the embryologist has to manually select the sperm for injection.
currently the WHO has some selection criteria including head length, circularity, presence or absence of vacuoles. Motility is currently assessed at sample level by CASA and visually by embryologist.
current DNA integrity tests determine percentage of spems with fragmented DNA in the sample. but DNA quality is not currently considered for ART cycles.
